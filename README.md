## About Me

Hey there! 👋

I'm goldkunibert and I make Discord bots just for fun. I code mostly in Python (the one with the snakes, not the one with the fangs 🐍). People say I'm funny though my bots still haven't laughed at my jokes. Maybe that's a feature request?

Social situations? Uh, I'd rather debug a 500-line function than ask a stranger for directions. But hey, at least my bots never judge!

Fun Fact: I love trains! 🚂

If you want to chat bots, Python, or just send train memes, you can find me at goldkunibert_ on Discord.

Stay Nice
